* Description
  A simple python script that gives the color of the pixel at which
  the mouse is pointed.  This script is intended to serve as an aid to
  people who are color-blind.
* Installation
*** Windows
    1. Install [[http://www.python.org/download/][Python]]
    2. Install [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/][pywin32]]
    3. Get the source code of prang and execute the script prang.py.
*** Unix/Linux
    1. Install Python
    2. Install pygtk
    3. Install python-xlib
    4. Install [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyZenity][PyZenity]]
    5. Get the source code of prang and execute the script prang.py.
* How it works
  1. It picks up the RGB values of the pixel at which the mouse
     pointer is present.
  2. Looks up the color from a look-up table and returns the color if,
     it is present in the look-up table.
  3. Else, calculates the nearest neighbor and returns the name of
     that color. [An asterisk indicates this approximation]
  4. This color name is then shown in a pop-up window.


  Ideally, this script should be hooked to a short-cut key, so as to
  run it with ease.
